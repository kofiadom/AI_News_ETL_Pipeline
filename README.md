# What'sUpWithAI: An ETL Data Pipeline for Real-time AI News Updates

## Project Overview
**What'sUpWithAI** is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline designed to fetch, process, and store real-time news updates on artificial intelligence. Utilizing Docker to host Airflow and leveraging Python scripts for data extraction and transformation, the pipeline ingests data into PostgreSQL and AWS S3 for efficient storage and analysis.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/whatsupwithai.git
   cd whatsupwithai



   Set up environment variables:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Update the .env file with your NewsAPI key, PostgreSQL credentials, and AWS S3 credentials.

Build and run the Docker containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Access the Airflow web interface at http://localhost:8080 and trigger the DAG.
