# What'sUpWithAI: An ETL Data Pipeline for Real-time AI News Updates

## Project Overview
**What'sUpWithAI** is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline designed to fetch, process, and store real-time news updates on artificial intelligence. Utilizing Docker to host Airflow and leveraging Python scripts for data extraction and transformation, the pipeline ingests data into PostgreSQL and AWS S3 for efficient storage and analysis.
